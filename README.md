## Hi there I am Harishtejapeddi ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a master's student at IIT Madras.
* My research interests include Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for turbulent and multiphase flows, as well as parallel computing, GPU computing, and high-performance computing (HPC).
* I Work with a variety of programming languages and tools including C, Python, MATLAB, Fortran, and some C++.
* My GitHub page features repositories from my coursework and research projects, covering topics such as: 
     - CFD and numerical methods (finite volume & finite element methods)
     - Turbulence Modelling
     - Data-driven modeling
     - Parallel and GPU computing
* Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out for collaboration!
